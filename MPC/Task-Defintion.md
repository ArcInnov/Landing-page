# Defining the task

## Rough outline
Responsive website - different view for mobile and webpage 
Not our goal for the product

Larger frame like tap.io.
The same apperance in pc browser and mobile
Its going to be hardest step for me

Typeform menu

 
Page content - 5-6 content
5-6 quotes with a great font and good background


 The way this site works on mobile is how we want to work on both Mobile and Laptops — https://www.liinks.co/
I think this step contradicts above requirement

## Features
Nav bar / Menu bar
Content - Quotes in good font and great backround
First build Website that is responsive 
Then figure out EKAGI's demand

## Attack plan
In entireity the project seems daunting.

Lets base our landing page on liinks.co
